How to Install the Incognito Blocker Without Using the Chrome Web Store
If you'd like to install the Incognito Blocker extension manually (outside the Chrome Web Store), follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
You must be using the Google Chrome browser (this method also works with Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.).
Ensure you have the Incognito Blocker extension files, including manifest.json, background.js, blocked.html, blocked.js, icon.png, and other associated files.
Steps to Install:
Download or Clone the Extension Files:

Ensure that you have all the necessary files (manifest.json, background.js, blocked.html, etc.) in a single folder on your computer. If you received the files in a zip archive, extract them to a folder.
Enable Developer Mode in Chrome:

Open Google Chrome.
In the top-right corner, click the three vertical dots (⋮) and go to More tools > Extensions.
Once in the Extensions page, toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner.
Load the Unpacked Extension:

After enabling Developer mode, click on the button that says Load unpacked (usually located in the top-left corner).
In the dialog box, navigate to the folder where you saved the Incognito Blocker files and select the folder.
Verify the Installation:

After loading the extension, it should appear in the list of your extensions with the name Incognito Blocker.
Make sure the extension is toggled on (enabled).
Test the Extension:

Try opening an incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N or ⌘+Shift+N on macOS).
The extension should immediately block the incognito window and redirect you to the custom "Blocked Access" page.
Updating the Extension:
If you make changes to the extension files or receive updates:

Go back to the Extensions page in Chrome.
Click the Reload button under the Incognito Blocker extension to apply the changes.
Removing the Extension:
If you no longer need the Incognito Blocker extension:

Open the Extensions page (⋮ > More tools > Extensions).
Find the Incognito Blocker extension and click the Remove button.
