# Incognito-Blocker
Incognito Blocker prevents users from accessing incognito mode in Chrome. When an incognito tab is opened, it is blocked and the user is redirected to a custom page displaying their device name, IP address, and a counter showing how many attempts have been blocked. Ideal for monitoring private browsing.
